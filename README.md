# Financial-Calculator

This is one of my projects in the way to achieve "College Algebra with Python" certification at freeCodeCamp.org. It was designed using Python.

Functions for the Project
Define a function for calculating mortgage payments and a function for calculating investment balance. Use code you wrote in earlier steps. Each function should prompt for input and print the output.

More functions
Create a function that produces an interactive polynomial graph (with sliders). Use code from an earlier step.

New function
Create a function to print the time required for money to double, given the rate. Use the continuous growth formula from an earlier step.

Financial App
Build a financial app that calculates all of the following:

Mortgage payment - given principle, rate, time
Retirement account balance at time of retirement
Time required for money to double - given the rate
Rate of growth - given starting value, time, and ending value
